# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Everything a Beginner Should Know

## History

## Rules and Objectives

## Health and Safety

BJJ is a combat sport. This means that while it is incredibly rewarding, there is always a risk of injury. Training in a safe way is one of the most important values in our dojo, and as a beginner you should know what to expect and how to protect yourself and your partners.  

### Common Injuries
Smaller injuries are not unusual. Scratches, bruises (sometimes even black eyes), or stretched muscles and ligaments are part of the learning process. They usually heal quickly and are no cause for alarm.  

However, our main goal is to **minimize the likelihood and severity of serious injuries**. These include:  

- Torn ligaments  
- Broken bones  
- Head trauma  
- Damage to the spine  

The most dangerous injuries in BJJ are neck injuries. Almost all fatal or life-changing cases in the sport involve the neck. For example, in 2018 a beginner student in the U.S. suffered a tragic accident that left him paralyzed after twisting his neck during sparring.

These kinds of incidents are **incredibly rare**, and it is our responsibility as a team to keep them that way.

### How to Train Safely

Here are the most important things you can do to avoid injury:  

#### Tap Early, Tap Often  
“Tapping” means signaling your partner to stop. You should tap whenever your partner has a submission locked in, or even if you’re simply stuck in an unknown situation.  
- You tap by clearly slapping your partner’s body twice.  
- If your arms are trapped, you can also tap verbally by saying *“Tap!”* or *“Stop!”*.  
- Tapping with your feet by stomping the ground twice is possible too, but keep in mind it may be harder for your partner to notice.  

Never hesitate to tap. It’s the smartest and safest choice.  

#### Respect the Tap  
If your partner taps, you **must stop immediately** and let go. Nothing is more important than this rule. When we train BJJ, we literally trust our partners with our health—and sometimes our life. Respecting the tap builds the trust we need to train together.  

#### Focus on Position, Not Submission  
Many injuries happen because a submission is applied too quickly without proper control. First establish positional control, then go for the submission. This not only makes you a better grappler, but also gives your partner time to react and tap safely.  

#### Listen to Your Instructors  
If an instructor tells you to stop mid-roll, you stop. There are many possible reasons:  
- You may unknowingly be in a dangerous position.  
- You might be too close to another group and risk bumping heads.  
Trust their judgment—it’s for your safety.

### Forbidden Techniques in Sparring
To further reduce risk, we do not allow certain techniques during sparring unless explicitly agreed upon beforehand. These are banned because they put extreme stress on joints, the spine, or the neck:  

- **Knee-twisting submissions** (e.g., heel hooks, toe holds)  
- **Spinal attacks** (e.g., twisters)  
- **Neck-cranking techniques** (e.g., excessive stacking, can openers)

By following these principles, you’ll not only protect yourself but also help create a safe, respectful training environment for everyone.

## Hygiene and Skincare

*Gym Hygiene*
- Always sweep mats first to remove hair, fuzz, and debris.
- Disinfect with a *hospital-grade, intermediate-level* disinfectant.
- Read the label: check for effectiveness against staph, ringworm, herpes, and molluscum.
- Replace worn or frayed mat tape regularly.

*Common Skin Infections*

Staph (Staphylococcus aureus)
- Carried by 30–50% of people, often without symptoms.
- Causes impetigo, abscesses, boils, and potentially fatal infections.
- *Do not train* with staph, even if covered.
- Requires oral antibiotics. Tea tree oil and OTC ointments are *not* effective.

Ringworm (Tinea)
- Caused by dermatophyte fungi like *Trichophyton*.
- Spread by skin contact or contaminated surfaces.
- Preventable by washing gear in *hot water* and drying thoroughly.

Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1)
- Causes cold sores; can spread to face, neck, or eye (herpes gladiatorum).
- Highly contagious. *Do not train* with an outbreak.
- Treated with antivirals like valacyclovir.

Molluscum Contagiosum
- Viral infection causing small, pink, dimpled bumps.
- Mild and self-limiting but still contagious.

*Non-Contagious Conditions (Safe to Train With)*

Psoriasis
- Autoimmune disease causing red, scaly plaques.
- Not contagious. Safe to train.
- Exercise and moisturization help reduce flare-ups.

Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)
- Skin barrier dysfunction. Dry, itchy skin; prone to staph.
- Use gentle soap (e.g., Dove Sensitive Bar).
- Moisturize *immediately* after lukewarm shower.

Acne
- Often worsened by friction (e.g. rash guards).
- Treat with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid washes.
- Oral antibiotics or isotretinoin (*Accutane*) for severe cases.
- Accutane is safe when monitored; birth defect risk applies only during use.

*Training Recommendations*
- Do *not* train with contagious infections or open, oozing wounds.
- Minor cuts must be covered with full-adhesive bandages + optional Vaseline layer.
- If bleeding, stop training and disinfect all affected areas.

*Best Skincare Practices for Grapplers*
- Shower immediately after training using warm water and mild soap.
- Moisturize after showering to repair skin barrier.
- Avoid hot water and harsh soaps.
- Wear rash guards and spats — they reduce skin exposure.
- Wash gi, rash guards, and belt in *hot water* with detergent, then tumble dry.
- Vinegar helps with odor but is *not* a disinfectant.

*Other Tips*
- For sun protection, prioritize long sleeves and wide-brim hats over sunscreen.
- If your gear still smells after washing, it may need to be retired.

*Final Advice*
Basic hygiene matters most:
Wash your hands. Shower after class. Wash your gear. Don’t train with infections.
