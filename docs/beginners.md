# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Everything a Beginner Should Know

## History

## Rules and Objectives

## Health and Safety

BJJ is a combat sport. This means that while it is incredibly rewarding, there is always a risk of injury. Training in a safe way is one of the most important values in our dojo, and as a beginner you should know what to expect and how to protect yourself and your partners.  

### Common Injuries
Smaller injuries are not unusual. Scratches, bruises (sometimes even black eyes), or stretched muscles and ligaments are part of the learning process. They usually heal quickly and are no cause for alarm.  

However, our main goal is to **minimize the likelihood and severity of serious injuries**. These include:  

- Torn ligaments  
- Broken bones  
- Head trauma  
- Damage to the spine  

The most dangerous injuries in BJJ are neck injuries. Almost all fatal or life-changing cases in the sport involve the neck. For example, in 2018 a beginner student in the U.S. suffered a tragic accident that left him paralyzed after twisting his neck during sparring.

These kinds of incidents are **incredibly rare**, and it is our responsibility as a team to keep them that way.

### How to Train Safely

Here are the most important things you can do to avoid injury:  

#### Tap Early, Tap Often  
“Tapping” means signaling your partner to stop. You should tap whenever your partner has a submission locked in, or even if you’re simply stuck in an unknown situation.  
- You tap by clearly slapping your partner’s body twice.  
- If your arms are trapped, you can also tap verbally by saying *“Tap!”* or *“Stop!”*.  
- Tapping with your feet by stomping the ground twice is possible too, but keep in mind it may be harder for your partner to notice.  

Never hesitate to tap. It’s the smartest and safest choice.  

#### Respect the Tap  
If your partner taps, you **must stop immediately** and let go. Nothing is more important than this rule. When we train BJJ, we literally trust our partners with our health—and sometimes our life. Respecting the tap builds the trust we need to train together.  

#### Focus on Position, Not Submission  
Many injuries happen because a submission is applied too quickly without proper control. First establish positional control, then go for the submission. This not only makes you a better grappler, but also gives your partner time to react and tap safely.  

#### Listen to Your Instructors  
If an instructor tells you to stop mid-roll, you stop. There are many possible reasons:  
- You may unknowingly be in a dangerous position.  
- You might be too close to another group and risk bumping heads.  

Trust their judgment—it’s for your safety.

### Forbidden Techniques in Sparring
To further reduce risk, we do not allow certain techniques during sparring unless explicitly agreed upon beforehand. These are banned because they put extreme stress on joints, the spine, or the neck:  

- **Knee-twisting submissions** (e.g., heel hooks, toe holds)  
- **Spinal attacks** (e.g., twisters)  
- **Neck-cranking techniques** (e.g., excessive stacking, can openers)

By following these principles, you’ll not only protect yourself but also help create a safe, respectful training environment for everyone.

## Hygiene and Skincare

In a sport like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, where we spend a lot of time in close body contact with many training partners, it is unfortunately impossible to completely rule out infectious skin diseases.  

### Common Skin Conditions
Some skin infections are irritating but relatively harmless:  
- **Ringworm** and **Herpes** can cause itchy, dry skin or pimples.  

However, others can be far more dangerous:  
- **Staph infections** are serious and can lead to life-threatening complications if not treated quickly.  

To highlight how severe this can be, former MMA fighter and wrestler Ben Askren required a **double lung transplant** in 2025 after suffering pneumonia linked to a previous staph infection.

### Keeping Yourself and the Mats Safe
For everyone’s safety, it is essential that we keep both ourselves and the training environment clean. Here are some key habits to adopt:  

#### Don’t Leave the Mat Barefoot  
A simple but important rule: **On the mat you’re barefoot, off the mat you wear slippers.**  
- This prevents bringing dirt or bacteria from street shoes onto the mat.  
- Going to the bathroom barefoot is especially forbidden.  

#### Clean the Mats  
After training, sweep the mats to remove hair, fuzz, and debris. Then disinfect with a **hospital-grade disinfectant spray** to kill harmful bacteria and fungi.  

#### Keep Your Nails Short  
Scratches from long fingernails or toenails are the perfect entry point for infections. Always keep your nails trimmed and filed to avoid injuring your partners.  

#### Wear Layers  
Many skin diseases spread through **direct skin-to-skin contact**. To minimize risk:  
- Always wear your gi jacket and pants.  
- Underneath, wear a rashguard and spats for an additional protective layer.  

#### Check Yourself Regularly  
Examine your skin for unusual spots, rashes, or pimples. If you notice anything suspicious, consult a dermatologist or ask an experienced teammate for advice.  

#### Stay Off the Mats if Infected  
Covering an infected area with tape or clothing is not enough. If you have a contagious condition, you must not train until it has fully healed.  

#### Shower Immediately After Training  
Showering right after class removes sweat, dirt, and bacteria before they can settle into your skin.  

#### Wash Your Gear  
Wash your gi, rashguard, and belt after each training session. Clean gear helps protect both you and your training partners.

By following these hygiene practices, we can keep the dojo safe and healthy for everyone. Clean mats and clean bodies mean more enjoyable training sessions and fewer risks of infection.  

## Equipment

One of the great things about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is that it does not require much equipment. This makes the sport relatively affordable and also convenient for training while traveling or on vacation. That being said, here is a list of the essentials — and some optional extras — you may want to consider.  

---

### Gi (Required)  
The **gi**, sometimes also called a *kimono*, is the loose-fitting uniform worn in martial arts.  

- If you already have a **judo gi**, that will work perfectly fine for BJJ.  
- Gis from other martial arts, like karate or aikido, are usually too thin and will most likely tear during practice.  
- Traditional colors are white, blue, and black, but any color or design is welcome.  
- When buying a gi, make sure it comes with a **white belt** (many beginner models do).  
- We also sell some **second-hand gis** within the club.  
- Always wash your gi between training sessions. If you plan on training multiple times per week, consider buying a second one.

### Rash Guard and Spats (Required)  
These are the **tight-fitting lycra clothes** worn underneath your gi.

- They provide comfort and help reduce the risk of spreading skin diseases by adding an extra layer of protection.  

---

### Gum Shield (Required)  
Even though BJJ does not involve strikes to the head, a gum shield is required to protect your teeth during sparring.  

- A light gum shield that fits the upper jaw is usually sufficient.

### Head Gear (Optional)  
BJJ can sometimes cause damage to the ear cartilage, leading to **cauliflower ear**. This condition can be painful, affect hearing, and is not very aesthetic.  

- Whether you are at risk depends largely on the shape and sensitivity of your ears.  
- If you are prone to cartilage damage, wearing headgear during sparring is advised.  
- Make sure the headgear has **no hard pieces** that could injure your partner.  

**Recommended Headgear:** [Tenace Earmuffs](https://amzn.eu/d/gpzcS0g)  

---

### Groin Guard (Optional)  
During sparring, accidental knees, kicks, or steps to the groin can happen.  

- Some men prefer wearing a groin guard for extra protection.  
- As with headgear, make sure it does not contain **hard plastic or metal parts** that could hurt your training partner.

With just these few items, you’ll be fully equipped to start your BJJ journey safely and comfortably.
