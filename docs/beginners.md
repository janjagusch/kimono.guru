# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Everything a Beginner Should Know

## History

To appreciate modern Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), it helps to understand its roots and how it evolved into the art we practice today.

### Origins in Japan and the Birth of Judo

Jujutsu is an ancient Japanese martial art developed by samurai in feudal Japan. It encompassed grappling, joint locks, throws, and techniques for unarmed combat.

In the late 19th century, **Jigoro Kano** reformed and systematized techniques from various jujutsu schools, emphasizing safety, pedagogy, and moral education. His work gave birth to **Judo**, a modern, structured version of the old jujutsu systems.

### From Japan to Brazil: Mitsuyo Maeda

In the early 20th century, **Mitsuyo Maeda**, a high-ranking student in Kano’s system, traveled the world giving demonstrations and participating in challenge matches.

Around 1914, Maeda arrived in Brazil and began teaching grappling — then considered a form of “Kano jiu-jitsu” or Judo — to **Carlos Gracie** and others. Carlos, along with his brothers (including Hélio Gracie), adapted and refined the techniques over time, placing more emphasis on leverage, ground control, and submissions.

### Spread to the U.S. and the Birth of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

In the late 20th century, members of the Gracie family began promoting the style internationally. **Rorion Gracie** played a key role in spreading BJJ in the United States.

In 1993, Rorion collaborated with promoter Art Davie to create the **Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)** as a platform to showcase the effectiveness of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu against fighters from various disciplines.

The success of **Royce Gracie**, who won several early UFC tournaments using submission grappling against larger opponents, dramatically increased global recognition of BJJ.

### Divergence from Judo

While Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu shares common roots with Judo, the two have diverged significantly. Judo emphasizes throws, takedowns, and standing exchanges, whereas BJJ focuses on groundwork, positional control, and submissions.

Over time, BJJ has developed its own rule sets, strategies, and competition circuits, becoming a distinct martial art and sport in its own right.

## Rules and Objectives

Simply put, the goal of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is to **immobilize your partner** and to **force them to give up (tap)** through a submission.

A _submission_ is a technique that puts your opponent in a position where continuing would cause injury or unconsciousness, forcing them to tap to stop the match.

---

### How a Match Works

A typical match starts with both practitioners standing and ends when one person taps or when the timer runs out (usually between 5 and 10 minutes, depending on the competition or class format).

If time runs out without a tap, the winner is decided by **points**. Points are awarded for achieving and maintaining **dominant positions**, where you control your partner’s body. Examples include:

- **Guard pass** – moving past your opponent’s legs into a controlling position
- **Mount** – sitting on your opponent’s torso and controlling their upper body
- **Back control** – attaching yourself to your opponent’s back with hooks and grips

The exact scoring system and point values differ between organizations, but the core principle is always control and progression.

---

### Focus on Ground Fighting

Unlike Judo, where matches often restart when the fight hits the ground, **BJJ continues until someone submits or time expires**. This focus on **ground control** is what makes BJJ unique.

BJJ also allows a wider range of submissions, including:

- **Leg locks** (in advanced divisions)
- **Chokes** that don’t rely on the jacket (no-gi techniques)

---

### What’s Not Allowed

Even though BJJ is a combat sport, it is **not MMA**. Strikes, kicks, and slams are strictly prohibited.

Other actions that are typically forbidden include:

- Small joint manipulation (e.g., bending individual fingers or toes)
- Spinal attacks or neck cranks
- Eye gouging, hair pulling, or grabbing fingers
- Applying submissions too quickly or with excessive force

---

### Rolling and Etiquette

In training, sparring is often called **rolling**. A roll is a live grappling round with a partner, usually lasting a few minutes.

- Before starting, partners **slap hands and bump fists** as a sign of respect.
- When the roll ends, always thank your partner — they help you improve and stay safe.
- If you accidentally roll into another pair, stop immediately and reposition.

---

### Training vs. Competing

In regular class rolls, the goal isn’t to “win,” but to **practice techniques safely** and **learn from each exchange**. Competition matches, on the other hand, are about testing your skills under rules and pressure — but the fundamentals of control, safety, and respect remain the same.

---

By understanding these basic rules and objectives, you’ll not only grasp how BJJ matches work, but also learn how to train responsibly and respectfully — the essence of good jiu-jitsu.

## Health and Safety

Now that you understand the structure of BJJ matches, let’s talk about how to stay safe while training.

BJJ is a combat sport. This means that while it is incredibly rewarding, there is always a risk of injury. Training safely is one of the most important values in our dojo, and as a beginner you should know what to expect and how to protect yourself and your partners.

### Common Injuries

Smaller injuries are not unusual. Scratches, bruises (sometimes even black eyes), or stretched muscles and ligaments are part of the learning process. They usually heal quickly and are no cause for alarm.

However, our main goal is to **minimize the likelihood and severity of serious injuries**. These include:

- Torn ligaments
- Broken bones
- Head trauma
- Damage to the spine

The most dangerous injuries in BJJ are neck injuries. Almost all fatal or life-changing cases in the sport involve the neck. For example, in 2018 a beginner student in the U.S. suffered a tragic accident that left him paralyzed after twisting his neck during sparring.

This was an **extraordinary and tragic incident**, and it has received widespread media attention precisely because such severe injuries are **exceptionally rare** in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It serves as a reminder of why safety is our top priority.

### How to Train Safely

Here are the most important things you can do to avoid injury:

#### Tap Early, Tap Often

“Tapping” means signaling your partner to stop. You should tap whenever your partner has a submission locked in, or even if you’re simply stuck in an unknown situation.

- You tap by clearly slapping your partner’s body twice.
- If your arms are trapped, you can also tap verbally by saying _“Tap!”_ or _“Stop!”_.
- You can also tap with your feet by stomping twice on the mat, though it may be harder for your partner to notice.

Never hesitate to tap. It’s the smartest and safest choice.

#### Respect the Tap

If your partner taps, you **must stop immediately** and let go. Nothing is more important than this rule. When we train BJJ, we literally trust our partners with our health — and sometimes our life. Respecting the tap builds the trust we need to train together.

#### Focus on Position, Not Submission

Many injuries happen because a submission is applied too quickly without proper control. First establish positional control, then go for the submission. This not only makes you a better grappler, but also gives your partner time to react and tap safely.

#### Listen to Your Instructors

If an instructor tells you to stop mid-roll, you stop. There are many possible reasons:

- You may unknowingly be in a dangerous position.
- You might be too close to another group and risk bumping heads.

Trust their judgment — it’s for your safety.

#### Avoid Wearing Jewelry and Piercings

Remove all jewelry, piercings, rings, and watches before training. These can easily cut your partner’s skin, get caught in clothing, or cause serious finger and ear injuries. Rings, in particular, can lead to severe accidents such as **degloving**, where skin and tissue are torn away.

Before stepping on the mat, double-check that you’ve removed all accessories — even small earrings or studs.

---

### Forbidden Techniques in Sparring

To further reduce risk, we do not allow certain techniques during sparring unless explicitly agreed upon beforehand. These are banned because they put extreme stress on joints, the spine, or the neck:

- **Knee-twisting submissions** (e.g., heel hooks, toe holds)
- **Spinal attacks** (e.g., twisters)
- **Neck-cranking techniques** (e.g., excessive stacking, can openers)
- **Jumping or flying techniques** (e.g., jumping guard pulls, flying armbars, kani basami) — these can cause accidental falls or impact injuries to your partner’s knees, neck, or back.  

---

By following these principles, you’ll not only protect yourself but also help create a safe, respectful training environment for everyone.

## Hygiene and Skincare

In a sport like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, where we spend a lot of time in close contact with many training partners, good hygiene keeps everyone healthy and training longer.

### Common Skin Conditions

Some skin infections are irritating but relatively harmless:

- **Ringworm** and **Herpes** can cause itchy, dry skin or pimples.

However, others can be far more dangerous:

- **Staph infections** are serious and can lead to life-threatening complications if not treated quickly.

To highlight how severe this can be, former MMA fighter and wrestler **Ben Askren** required a **double lung transplant** in 2025 after suffering pneumonia linked to a previous staph infection.

### Keeping Yourself and the Mats Clean

For everyone’s safety, it is essential that we keep both ourselves and the training environment clean. Here are some key habits to adopt:

#### Clean the Mats

After training, sweep the mats to remove hair, fuzz, and debris. Then disinfect with a **hospital-grade disinfectant spray** to kill harmful bacteria and fungi.

#### Don’t Leave the Mat Barefoot

A simple but important rule: **On the mat you’re barefoot, off the mat you wear slippers.**

- This prevents bringing dirt or bacteria from street shoes onto the mat.
- Going to the bathroom barefoot is especially forbidden.

#### Keep Your Nails Short

Scratches from long fingernails or toenails are the perfect entry point for infections. Always keep your nails trimmed and filed to avoid injuring your partners.

#### Wear Layers

Many skin diseases spread through **direct skin-to-skin contact**. To minimize risk:

- Always wear your gi jacket and pants.
- Underneath, wear a rashguard and spats for an additional protective layer.

#### Check Yourself Regularly

Examine your skin for unusual spots, rashes, or pimples. If you notice anything suspicious, consult a dermatologist or ask an experienced teammate for advice.

#### Stay Off the Mats if Infected

Covering an infected area with tape or clothing is not enough. If you have a contagious condition, you must not train until it has fully healed.

#### Shower Immediately After Training

Showering right after class removes sweat, dirt, and bacteria before they can settle into your skin.

#### Wash Your Gear

Wash your gi, rashguard, and belt after each training session. Clean gear helps protect both you and your training partners.

---

By following these hygiene practices, we can keep the dojo safe and healthy for everyone. Clean mats and clean bodies mean more enjoyable training sessions and fewer risks of infection.

## Equipment

Once you’ve got hygiene and safety covered, the next step is making sure you have the right gear.

One of the great things about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is that it does not require much equipment. This makes the sport relatively affordable and convenient for training while traveling or on vacation. That being said, here is a list of the essentials — and some optional extras — you may want to consider.

---

### Gi (Required)

The **gi**, sometimes also called a _kimono_, is the loose-fitting uniform used in martial arts.

- If you already have a **judo gi**, that will work perfectly fine for BJJ.
- Gis from other martial arts, like karate or aikido, are usually too thin and will most likely tear during practice.
- Traditional colors are white, blue, and black, but any color or design is welcome.
- When buying a gi, make sure it comes with a **white belt** (many beginner models do).
- We also sell some **second-hand gis** within the club.
- Always wash your gi between training sessions. If you plan on training multiple times per week, consider buying a second one.

---

### Rash Guard and Spats (Required)

These are the **tight-fitting lycra clothes** worn underneath your gi.

- They improve comfort and help reduce the risk of spreading skin diseases by adding an extra layer of protection.

---

### Gum Shield (Required)

Even though BJJ does not involve strikes to the head, a gum shield is required to protect your teeth during sparring.

- A light gum shield that fits the upper jaw is usually sufficient.

---

### Head Gear (Optional)

BJJ can sometimes cause damage to the ear cartilage, leading to **cauliflower ear**. This condition can be painful, affect hearing, and is not very aesthetic.

- Whether you are at risk depends largely on the shape and sensitivity of your ears.
- If you are prone to cartilage damage, wearing headgear during sparring is advised.
- Make sure the headgear has **no hard pieces** that could injure your partner.

**Recommended Headgear:** [Tenace Earmuffs](https://amzn.eu/d/gpzcS0g)

---

### Groin Guard (Optional)

During sparring, accidental knees, kicks, or steps to the groin can happen.

- Some men prefer wearing a groin guard for extra protection.
- As with headgear, make sure it does not contain **hard plastic or metal parts** that could hurt your training partner.
